This project was conceived within the framework of the Data Science Bootcamp 2023-2024 at Big Blue Data Academy. We explore a dataset containing diverse health metrics from individuals with heart conditions, encompassing factors such as age, blood pressure, heart rate, and more. Our aim is to construct a predictive model that can effectively discern individuals with heart disease.
